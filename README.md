# Absolute VIM Configuration

## Introduction

Here's the VIM configuration I'm going to be using for most of my professional work this year.
There may be changes as I discover new plugins. I intent to personalize this to my taste and
coding conventions. Feel free to try it out if you fancy ðŸ˜„.

## Installation

```bash

git clone https://github.com/boxpositron/absolute-vim ~/.config/nvim --depth 1 && nvim

```
